This project shows the difference between **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project structure
- ssr.html → page with content already in HTML (SSR)
- csr.html → page that uses JS to render the content (CSR)
- style.css → shared styles for both pages
- script.js → JavaScript file to create the CSR content


## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `ssr.html` in your browser to see the **SSR version**.
3. Open `csr.html` in your browser to see the **CSR version**.

OBS⚠️ The CSR page depends on JavaScript. If JS is disabled, the content will not appear.
